## Hey, I’m Alsobe

![wave](https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif)

I build high-performance systems, tools, and experiments — mostly in **C++**, but I jump into whatever tech gets the job done.

I like solving hard problems, optimizing everything, and shipping fast.

### What I work on
- C++ systems programming  
- Game dev (UE5)   
- Kernel drivers  

### Tools I actually use
- C++, Unreal Engine, Python  
- React, TypeScript, Tailwind (for dashboards/UI)  
- VSCode, Visual Studio 
- Figma when things need to look clean  

Always building.  
If it's interesting, I’ll make it.
