## Hey, I’m Alsobe

![wave](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9fcde363f6e46385fd7bc47ef8edd937acaa2c872216105ab0475369f1c1a005/68747470733a2f2f656d6f6a69732e736c61636b6d6f6a69732e636f6d2f656d6f6a69732f696d616765732f313533363335313037352f343539342f626c6f622d776176652e676966)

I build high-performance systems, tools, and experiments — mostly in **C++**, but I jump into whatever tech gets the job done.

I like solving hard problems, optimizing everything, and shipping fast.

### What I work on
- C++ systems programming  
- Game dev (UE5)   
- Kernel drivers  

### Tools I actually use
- C++, Unreal Engine, Python  
- React, TypeScript, Tailwind (for dashboards/UI)  
- VSCode, Visual Studio 
- Figma when things need to look clean  

Always building.  
If it's interesting, I’ll make it.
